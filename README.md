# Screen Vision MCP Server

> Give Claude Code the ability to see your screen

Screen Vision lets Claude capture screenshots, watch your screen in real-time with audio transcription, analyze video files, and read text via OCR. It runs locally as an MCP server — Claude sees what you see, when you ask.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install screen-vision[ocr]
```

Then add to your Claude Code MCP config (`.mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screen-vision": {
      "command": "screen-vision-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**System deps for OCR and video:**
```bash
brew install tesseract   # Required for OCR (read_screen_text)
brew install ffmpeg      # Required for video analysis (analyze_video)
```

## What You Can Say

```
"Take a screenshot of my screen"          → capture_screen
"Capture the Chrome window"               → capture_window
"Watch my screen for 1 minute"            → watch_screen (with audio transcription)
"Analyze the video at ~/Downloads/demo.mp4" → analyze_video
"Read the text on my screen"              → read_screen_text
"What window am I in?"                    → get_active_context (no screenshot)
"What's on my screen right now?"          → understand_screen (AI analysis)
"Analyze this photo I AirDropped"         → analyze_image
```

## Security

Screen Vision includes security controls for corporate environments:

- **PII/PCI scanning** — Detects credit card numbers, SSNs, phone numbers, email addresses in OCR text
- **App deny-list** — Blocks captures of Slack, Teams, Zoom, banking apps, password managers
- **Call detection** — Blocks captures during active audio calls
- **Rate limits** — 200 captures/session, 2s minimum interval, 5min max watch duration
- **Audit logs** — All captures logged to `~/.screen-vision/audit.log`

Set `SCREEN_VISION_MODE=work` to enable all security controls. Default mode is `personal` (no restrictions).

## Dependencies

**Core** (always installed): `mcp[cli]`, `mss`, `Pillow`, `numpy`, `httpx`

**Extras** (mix and match):

| Extra | Install | What you get |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `[ocr]` | `pip install screen-vision[ocr]` | `pytesseract` — OCR via tesseract (~5MB, needs `brew install tesseract`) |
| `[paddle]` | `pip install screen-vision[paddle]` | `paddleocr` + `opencv-python-headless` — higher-accuracy OCR (~1GB, self-contained) |
| `[audio]` | `pip install screen-vision[audio]` | `faster-whisper` + `sounddevice` — audio transcription for `watch_screen` |
| `[full]` | `pip install screen-vision[full]` | All of the above |

**Python 3.11+ required.**
